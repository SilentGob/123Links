This python script is used to scrape the 123people website and get all the links.
It can be use to ask for the removal of the links you do not want published (see 123people website for how to send the links)

The links are sorted by sections (according to the 123people website) and when there is one the source is mentionned (source) after the link.

Usage:
123Links [-o outputMethod] 123PeopleURL

-o specifies the output method of the links (by default text)
	currently only 'html' is supported

Your 123PeopleURL must start with 'http://www.123people.'
