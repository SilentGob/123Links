This python script can be used to get all the links from a page of the 123people website.
The main goal is to ask for the removal of the links you do not want published (see the support section of the 123people website on how to send the links).

The links are sorted by sections (according to the 123people website) and when there is one the source is mentioned (source) after the link.

Usage:
123Links [-o outputMethod] 123PeopleURL

-o specifies the output method of the links (by default text)
	currently only 'html' is supported

Your 123PeopleURL must start with 'http://www.123people.'
